### Introduction:

-	Object detection training and testing project. in this project i have trained a car recognition learning machine using YOLO.
-	the project can be used to train any other object.

### About:

-	The following represents a car object recognition AI implemented using **Python and YOLO**. The project file contains **Image Files - zip** - the model is using those images to train, **ipynb file** - this file is training the AI and **yolo object detection python file** to test the AI .
-	you can use this project to get your own custom object detection machine. follow the instruction below and the documentation in the files.

### Installation:

-	First of all, **clone the repository** using:
```
git clone https://github.com/danivngopro/Car-Object-Detection.git
``` 
**OR**
Download the Zip and extract it's contents.

-	download labelImg and label your images. if you are new i recommand watching a quick tutorial on youtube.
-	Then open an IDE, i recommand COLAB - google python env and upload your images in a zipfile and train_yolov3.ipynb. run the project (ofc, change the class name of the object your are training and run the entire file.
-	after a while stop the training and go to your google drive where the files should have been to download your trained weights for testing.
-	change the name of the weights file accordingly and run the test file. this should open a window that records your screen and captures any car or object on it if you trained it well enough.
